# Virtual (On-screen) keyboard

Ubuntu comes with an on-screen keyboard feature that can be enabled in the Accessibility settings -> Typing -> Screen keyboard
The keyboard however is a tiny one and lacks of important keys. This can be fixed using the "Enhanced OSK" Gnome extension.

1. Install the Gnome Shell integration : ```sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell```
2. Go to https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6595/enhanced-osk/ and install the browser extension, reload the page and hit "Install"
3. Restart your Web Browser, reload the page and toggle the switch ON
4. Restart Ubuntu to apply the changes
5. Toggle the onscreen keyboard and enjoy an extended keyboard
