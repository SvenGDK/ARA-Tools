# Cannot install .NET Framework 3.5 from "Add Windows Features"

The Asus Windows 11 image is unfortunately bloated and there's a chance that it doesn't let you install .NET Framework 3.5 from "Add Windows Features".
Multiple installation retries and Windows restarts will not fix this issue, even if your Windows is up-to-date.

1. Backup your data
2. Reinstall Windows 11 using an USB drive created with the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool
