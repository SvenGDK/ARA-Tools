# On-screen Keyboard in Windows 11

If the keyboard doesn't show up automatically in Windows then you can :

- Press the Command Center button and tap the Keyboard option that appears in the menu.
- Hold the M1 or M2 button on the back and press Up on the D-Pad.

If you reinstall Windows 11 without using the Cloud Recovery then the touch Keyboard will not show up automatically.
You can change this setting in the Windows Settings -> Time & Language -> Typing -> Touch Keyboard -> Show the touch keyboard

Set it to "When no keyboard attached" and try if the keyboard shows up automatically.
If it doesn't work then set it to "Always", then back to "When no keyboard attached" and restart Windows.
