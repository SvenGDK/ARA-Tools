# Selecting an OS on the bootloader

Unfortunately the ROG Ally does not activate all gamepad controls or the touchscreen when booting into the GRUB bootloader so you won't be able to select an OS.

However if you boot into the UEFI settings you gain full touch and gamepad control. Selecting the bootloader from here will let you use the touchscreen and gamepad.

How to :
1. Boot into the UEFI settings (Power on with volume down)
2. Select "Boot Menu" from the bottom
3. Select the GRUB bootloader
4. From here you can select the OS with the D-Pad
