# Ajust GPU Memory Size

If you have a VRAM heavy game that’s stuttering while you play, or a game that won’t launch because there isn’t enough VRAM present, you may need to allocate more of the Ally’s shared memory toward VRAM. 
The Ally allocates 4GB of memory to VRAM by default, but you can raise it up to 8GB or lower it to 1GB.

To adjust the VRAM size :

1. Open Armoury Crate and go to Settings > Operating Mode > GPU Settings
2. Look for the dropdown next to Memory Assigned to GPU and change it to the value you require
3. Afterwards, reboot the Ally for the change to take effect
