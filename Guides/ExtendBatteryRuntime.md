# Extending the Battery Runtime

If you want to extend your game time as long as possible, here are a few tips to extend the battery life on your device :

- Update your software and drivers in Armory Crate SE & MyAsus
- Select the Performance or Silent mode instead of Turbo Mode
- Limit your FPS to 60 or 30 in non-FPS relevant games
- Use cloud streaming (uses less hardware power)
- Lower your screen brightness
- Use Standby Mode when you arenâ€™t using the Ally
